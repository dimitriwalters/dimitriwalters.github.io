<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Real Time Collaborative Markdown Editor</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/markdownerds/markdownerds">markdownerds/markdownerds</a></p>
<p>A hackathon project for MeteroHack 2015 that ended up winning for most technically impressive. Built in a team of three, we were inspired to create it because of our heavy use of markdown for school. We also disliked the lack of tools for editing in markdown, so we took ideas from the available markdown editors and created markdownerds. Developed using Meteor, ShareJS, MarkedJS, and Ace.</p>

<h3>URL Shortener</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dimitriwalters/url-shortener">dimitriwalters/url-shortener</a></p>
<p>Inspired by the hundreds of existing URL shorteners, I was curious enough to build my own and see how difficult it was to create a URL shortener service. After lectures one day, I went to the library, put some good music on, and in one session implemented a URL shortener using no backend language — only JavaScript and Firebase as a database — and pushed it to my webhost.</p>

<h3>Course Analytics</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dimitriwalters/course-analytics">dimitriwalters/course-analytics</a></p>
<p>Data mining has been something I’ve been interested in doing for a long time. I decided to start a project that will allow me to run data analytics, and the data I chose was courses. I created a server-side app using Node and Express, which allows a user to input course data into a MongoDB database, and show analytics on that data using map reduce. Some of my future plans include using charts and adding Hadoop to the picture.</p>

<h3>NPM Packages</h3>
<p><a href="https://npmjs.com/~dimitriwalters">npmjs.com/~dimitriwalters</a></p>
<p>A few years ago, I was a huge Node fanboy. I enjoyed writing in JavaScript, but I also liked npm and how the most common packages used were developed from users. I wanted to contribute as well, and have been writing packages since. I wrote packages to generate random data (such as numbers, elements), create binary strings and arrays based on run-length, do arithmetic in a different syntax, and a joke package based on left-pad.</p>
