This is a choose-your-own-adventure style answer to nearly any git problem you can face. It should be in every developer&#39;s bookmark.</p>
<p>Along with this resource, I thought I&#39;d share what I think is the perfect workflow for using git in a team. Using feature branches is the first step, but most importantly it is how other people&#39;s changes becomes merged. Here is the process, when someone wants to make a PR (pull request) - I&#39;m assuming the project is large enough to require PRs - do the following:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
git pull --rebase
git checkout [feature branch]
git rebase master
</code></pre><p>There will likely be conflicts, this is where the above guide comes in handy. Once the rebase is complete, submit the PR. If the branch looks good, simply <code>git merge [feature branch]</code> and that completes the workflow. This is what I have found works, and it is something I wish I had known earlier in my developer life - so hopefully this makes git a bit easier to work with!</p>
