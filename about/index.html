I'm currently a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Waterloo, in my 3B (third-year) term. I'm enrolled in the co-operative program, which means I occasionally spend a term outside of school completing co-op placements at a tech company.</p>
<p>I'm a person with many interests, who likes to do and learn new things. Programming-wise, I have many side-projects that I like to work on. I typically enjoy learning about a new technology, which I do by applying it into something in the real-world. I also have other hobbies that I like to pursue. I'm realy into playing sports, my favourite sports are Badminton and Basketball, but I also enjoy Soccer and running. I also play the piano, but I'm just a beginner for now. I used to be really into graphic design, though I still occasionally like to play around in Photoshop. Just a list of other stuff I like to do: hiking, watching anime, writing songs, going to parks, and anything else that sounds like a fun time.</p>
<p>I'm currently not in the market for work right now, but if you want to contact me for any other reason feel free to <a href="mailto:me@dimi.io">email</a> me anytime.</p></span></div></main></div></body></html>
